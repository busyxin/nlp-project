    "The dataset compiled by Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, assistant professor at the department of information science of the Cornell University, offers structured data reflecting the dialog corpus of 617 movies, additional meta information about them, such as title, genres, IMDB votes and rating, as well as details from every character intervening in the movie: name, gender, characterâ€™s importance according to the position in the credits. This dataset can be found here:  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html\n",
    "\n",
    "This data allows us to build a language model by processing the dialogs contained in the corpus, we hope to discern patterns that will allow us, for example, to predict the details of an unknown movie character given his or her lines in the script. Other possible applications would be classifying a new movie by genres by inputting the conversations. These are two possibilities derived from learning from the available corpus, if time allows it, we can even augment the existing data structure to infer more insights, i.e. relationship between characters, etc.."
